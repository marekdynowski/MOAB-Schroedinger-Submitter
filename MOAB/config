# MPATH ..... absolute pathname for the directory where the PBS
#             commands ('qsub', etc.) are installed.
# MPROFILE .. absolute pathname for a setup script, which will be
#               executed before running any queue commands.
# MSUB ...... the name of the job submission command (typically 'qsub')
# MDEL ...... the name of the job cancellation command (typically 'qdel')
# MSTAT ..... the name of the job status command (typically 'qstat')
#
# LICENSE_CHECKING ... support license checking?
#                      (any non-blank value turns on license-checking)
#
